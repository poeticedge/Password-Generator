# Password-Generator
Random Password Generator from a Scrimba lesson

Starter lesson for random password generator. Goal was to have a function that gave 2 random passwords when clicking the Generate button. 
I used the increment operator (++) to increase the value of my password. The length it 15. 
*Note: On occastion I see an error where the length of 15 is not honored. I will need to debug my code to find out why that is happening. 

I am using DOM manipulation to place the values in button 1 and 2 respectively.
